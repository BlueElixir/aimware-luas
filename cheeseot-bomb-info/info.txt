IMPORTANT!
This lua was made by Cheeseot (https://aimware.net/forum/user/215088), all credit belongs to him.

The Lua I released is a modification of what Cheeseot posted on the forums quite some time ago.
New stuff not found in the original Lua as of 05/01/2022:
- improved performance (no huge fps drops when bomb is planted)
- added a checkbox to switch from original to modified indicator positions, defaults to modified, can be turned off in "Visuals -> Overlay -> Weapon"

If you find any problems with the original Lua, ask for help on the forum.
If you find any problems with my release, PM me on the forum (404765) or make an issue on GitHub.
