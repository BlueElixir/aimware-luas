## Reporting Issues

Report any issues related to my scripts by creating an Issue on github or contacting me directly on discord @ BlueElixir#0985

If you find a bug/error/problem or something of similar sort in an older-than-supported version, please, do not report it, unless you can repeat the issue on the latest supported version.
